            <p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br><br><strong>Liability for Content</strong><br><br>
                The contents of these pages were created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the
                accuracy,
                completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own
                content on
                these pages under general laws according to § 7 para. 1 TMG (German Telemedia Act). According to §§ 8 to
                10 TMG,
                we as a service provider are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or
                to
                investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of
                information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible
                from the
                time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of such violations, we will remove
                this
                content immediately.<br><br><strong>Liability for Links</strong><br><br>
                Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence.
                Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or
                operator of
                the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for
                possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of
                linking. However, a permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without
                concrete
                evidence of a violation of the law. Upon becoming aware of violations, we will remove such links
                immediately.<br><br><strong>Copyright</strong><br><br>
                The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.
                The
                reproduction, editing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright

                Should
                you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we become
                aware of
                any infringements, we will remove such content immediately.<br><br><strong>Data
